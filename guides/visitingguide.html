            <h3>Recomendation</h3>
            <p>
                If you live outside the NCR+ (which includes CALARZON),
                we recommend that you should be careful when visiting.
                Also, avoid visiting the city on particular days of the month that are close to 15 or 30;
                on these days, a new quarantine protocol or alert levels will be implemented.
