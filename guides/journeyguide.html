                Visiting Santa Rosa City can be fun. You may go to the Enchanted Kingdom*,
                the most visited tourist spot in Laguna.
                You may take a walk in the Nuvalli or have a glimpse of the past in the Santa Rosa city proper
                (Santa Rosa Bayan).
                However, the presence of a global scale pandemic caused by a coronavirus has made traveling restricted,
                but still, traveling is possible.

            <p>
                If you have your car, you would normally enter Santa Rosa City thru SLEX.
                The image above shows the map of the SLEX entrance and exit in Santa Rosa.
                Exiting SLEX and you will reach Felix Road. With that, you will be faced with two paths,
                going north and you will close to Enchanted Kindom while the other path (going south of Felix Road)
                will lead to Nuvalli Park and Tagaytay.
                Please use Assitant Tour to find out your path to the place you want to visit
                However, the traffic on this road can be heavy especially during rush hour.

            <img src='https://galavtg.github.io/guides/assets/balibagoroadmap.jpg' alt='slexmap'  class='image'/>
            <p>
                If you commute (thru riding a bus), you would normally drop off at the Barangay Balibago Complex Santa Rosa.
                The image above shows the map. Balibago Complex is one of the busiest and crowded places in Santa Rosa,
                because of Bus Terminals, Malls (such as Target Mall),
                Grocery Stores, Tiangge, Restaurant, Fast Food Chain and more.
                Going to Enchanted Kindom will take only a single ride of tricycle and going to Santa Rosa City Proper
                (Santa Rosa Bayan) takes a single ride of a Jeep (as of now, the fare cost is P10).

            <h3 id="3">To Santa Rosa Bayan (City Proper)</h3>
            <p>
                Santa Rosa City proper (Santa Rosa bayan) is a place you could still see a glimpse of the past.
                The City Plaza is dedicated to Dr. Jose Rizal, World War 2 veterans, and local events.
                On the left side of the park is the Museum of Santa Rosa.
                It was a former municipal building that was used during Spanish colonization.
                Behind the plaza is the Sta. Rosa Delima Parish church (Diocese of San Pablo)
                and was built in the year 1792. Santa Rosa Market, municipal hall, NBI building,
                a historic Santa Rosa Archway, ancestral houses, and more.

                If you are in Enchanted Kindom, SLEX entrance, or in Nuvali/Solenad,
                the first thing to do is to reach Balibago Complex (Bus Terminal).
                Then, head outside the Complex (note of the one-way road) or by riding a
                jeepney heading "Santa Rosa Bayan" or "Tagapo".
                Tagapo is a barangay in Santa Rosa close to city proper (bayan). The fare is only P10.
