            Recently, the national government has used quarantine protocols as a sign of "strictness" that is implemented in an area. These are commonly known as ECQ (Enhance Community Quarantine), MECQ (Modified Enhance Community Quarantine), and GCQ (General Community Quarantine). There are three levels of rules that constrict people's activity. However, as Covid-19 vaccinated people are more than 20% of the Philippines population and decreasing number of cases per day, a new guide is implemented.
        </p>

        <b>This new guideline is called Covid-19 Alert Levels that has five (5) levels. These are: </b>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Alert Level 1</h4>
                Refers to areas wherein case transmission is low and decreasing, total bed utilization rate, and intensive care unit utilization rate is low.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Alert Level 2</h4>
                Refers to areas wherein case transmission is low and decreasing, healthcare utilization is low, or case counts are low but increasing, or case counts are low and decreasing but total bed utilization rate and intensive care unit utilization rate is increasing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Alert Level 3</h4>
                Refers to areas wherein case counts are high and/or increasing, with total bed utilization rate and intensive care unit utilization rate at increasing utilization. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Alert Level 5</h4>
                Refers to areas wherein case counts are alarming, with total bed utilization rate and intensive care unit utilization rate at critical utilization
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            Luckily Santa Rosa city is now under alert level 2 (as of this writing) that enables to travel freely across the city. You may now get a ride into the Enchanted Kingdom or take foods trips in malls. Remember that many dine-in establishments and theme parks require a fully vaccinated individual to enjoy this.
